# KnowYourFood

Know Your Food is a highly secure system that keeps a track of the Food Quality in the Organized Sector of the food chain supply in India.
It uses the concept of Blockchain, a secure distributed ledger, to store details of the transactions that the farmer does with the seed and fertilizer companies. Tracking the seed and fetilizer quality implies the basic quality assurance of the food also. 
***This project doesn't take more quality paramters into consideration, can be considered as a future scope of the project***

From the user's point of view, this system provides complete transparency of the food chain supply of the organized industry. The users can log into the application and by selecting the local postal code, name of the vendor and the crop details, the users can get to know insights of what is seed and fetilizer quality, or basically what is the food quality that is sold in that region. Hence Users can decide if they should continue buying from the same place or change places to buy better quality food. 

Such a transparency will create competition amongst the food companies and they will be obliged to buy better quality food from the traders even though it cost them more.
Atleast the aims is that the food in every region has great quality.
